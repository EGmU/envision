# SiteVision CSS Framework #

## Getting started ##
1. Clone repository
2. Install [gulp-cli](http://gulpjs.com/) `npm install -g gulp-cli`
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## To build ##
Run `gulp`

To build continously when a file is saved. Start `gulp watch`

## Code standard ##
We are using the BEM model as described [here](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)

Markup should comply to the [WAI-ARIA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/)


## Build docs ##
[Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) with `gem install bundler`, and finally run `bundle install`. This will install all Ruby dependencies, such as Jekyll and plugins.

From console run `jekyll serve`
